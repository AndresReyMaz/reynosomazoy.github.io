I"E<p>Welcome to Jekyll-Indieweb. The goal of this project was to provide someone without a web presence a quick and easy way to start using the basics of the <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com">Indieweb</a>.</p>

<p>Currently supported are microformats, including an author h-card on the home page. Social media links are configurable in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>. Where applicable, fill in either your profile link or nick name for each profile you wold like to link to. Remember, empty values will not show up in the h-card.</p>

<p>Also configurable is whether or not you would like to receive <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/Webmention">webmentions</a> on your posts. Leave <code class="highlighter-rouge">webmentions:</code> blank. The built in support is for Voxpelli’s <a href="https://webmention.herokuapp.com">webmention end point</a>. Simply register with the service and set the configuration to <strong>yes</strong>. Read further in the wiki about webmetnions.</p>

<p>Currently there isn’t a simple method for sending webmentions with static blogs, especially hosted on GitHub, but as soon as a solution is in place, I will update this project. If you are adventurous, feel free to ping me in the  IRC channel and I can share my method.</p>

<p>Finally, I attempted to make the <em>design</em> of this project as un-opinionated as I could, but maintain an aesthetic that someone just starting out would comfortable with and still be able to easily customize.</p>
